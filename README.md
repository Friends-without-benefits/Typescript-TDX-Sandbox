# TDX Typescript Template

A template for working with the TDX api in TypeScript. Includes an async go() function to handle things, askQuestion() to get user input, and ding() to make the terminal go ding, good for letting a user know to scan another item or the like.

`yarn start` builds and runs main.ts
